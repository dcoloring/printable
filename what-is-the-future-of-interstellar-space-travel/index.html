Imagine being an astronaut and planning for a space mission you know you have no chance of joining; Wormholes are an attractive approach to ftl technology. This implies that a highly advanced rocketry system is required to accomplish this mission. Will the future of interstellar space travel be bright, or will it always be a dream?
