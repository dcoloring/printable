<p>The spaceship earth concept, also known as spacecraft earth or spaceship planet earth, is a worldview built on cooperation and understanding, a perspective that seeks to work for the ‘greater good.’. There are some interesting implications of the spaceship earth metaphor. The story of the spaceship provides a metaphor for mankind’s environmental impact on the earth. Some have argued that depicting the earth as such is seductive, but borders on the arrogant by implying, as fuller seems to, that humans can completely control the operations of the earth.
